Guideline for how to branch and develop our parts

  1) Developer will be the Main branch we use as our editing branch
  2) If making a new feature make a branch off of the developer branch named specifically the feature working on
  3) Once fully complete commit to the developer
  4) Once we all commit our changes and are working in developer we push the developer branch to the main to save our new working version
